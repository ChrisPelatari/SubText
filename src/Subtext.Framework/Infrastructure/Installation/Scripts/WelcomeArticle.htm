<h2>Subtext supports articles!</h2>
<p>
Articles are typically used for more traditional long-form style of writing as you might 
find in a magazine article. They tend to cover more timeless topics and do not show up 
in your main feed.
</p>
<p>
For example, you might write an &#8220;About Me&#8221; page as an article and then 
link to it from the <em>News</em> section in the sidebar.

<p>
To create/edit/delete articles just visit the <a href="{0}" title="Articles Section">articles section of the admin</a>.
